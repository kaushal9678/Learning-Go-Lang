## Prerequisites
- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.18 or higher installed on your system

## Project Structure
```

go run profit_calculator.go
```

### Run the Note CLI
```bash
cd note
go run main.go
```

## Example Usage
- The `hello` project demonstrates a simple profit calculator.
- The `note` project is a basic CLI for note-taking, demonstrating Go modules and package structure.
